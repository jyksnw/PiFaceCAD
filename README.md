# PiFaceCAD
C# Library for the PiFaceCAD

PiFaceCAD is a port of the C library [libpifaceca](https://github.com/piface/libpifacecad)

This library requires that the [libmcp23s17](https://github.com/piface/libmcp23s17) library is cloned and built as a shared library. The resulting libmcp23s17.so should be placed in the same directory as the PiFaceCAD.dll.
